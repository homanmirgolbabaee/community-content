The DeepSeek R1 model provides a lightweight yet powerful solution for basic natural language processing tasks. Optimized for speed and efficiency, this model delivers reliable performance for text classification, entity recognition, and simple text generation.

## Key Features
- **4K Token Context Window**: Handles medium-length documents effectively
- **Multi-Lingual Support**: Base capabilities in 5 major languages
- **Low Resource Requirements**: Runs efficiently on standard hardware
- **Fine-Tuning Ready**: Compatible with common ML frameworks

## Start Building with DeepSeek R1

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("deepseek/deepseek-r1-base")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek/deepseek-r1-base")

inputs = tokenizer("Translate to French: Hello world", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
